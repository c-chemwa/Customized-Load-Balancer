# Customized-Load-Balancer
Implementation of a load balancer that routes the requests coming from several clients asynchronously among several servers so that the load is nearly evenly distributed among them.

## ðŸ“Œ Task 1: Web Server

This task implements a simple web server using **Python Flask**, containerized with Docker. Each server instance responds with its unique ID and a heartbeat check, which will later be used by the load balancer.
